# BERT-IMDB
Implementation of the BERT model to classify the IMDb Dataset.

In this project, I implemented the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model in order to classify IMDb reviews into a positive or negative class. I used the Large Movie Review Dataset, which contains 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing, all labeled with their original classes. The fine-tuned BERT model achieved an accuracy of 90%. I also examined some attention matrices.
